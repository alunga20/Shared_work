Immense scientific progress has been made in recent centuries, and the time period required to double our knowledge continues to shrink. In recent decades, the sequencing of genomes from diverse species has been a primary driving force behind the expansion of biological knowledge. It has become central to the study of molecular and organismal evolution. The technologies that, for example, enable genomics, molecular medicine, and computing to forge forward at such rapid interdependent paces, are recognized as central to our understanding of Earthâ€™s biosphere and sustaining it for future generations.
